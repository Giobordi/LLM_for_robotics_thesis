## REQUIREMENTS 
- Map each user request with the corresponding location in the house.
- Divide the user input into multiple steps, each step should be a single task that can be performed in a single location.
- Pay attention that the robot can only carry one order at a time, in case of multiple requests it is necessary to divide it into multiple actions (for example multiple order should be COMPLETED one at time). 
- Pay attention to the structure of the plan, it is possible that the user input not explicitly mention all the steps needed to complete the task, so you need to add them.
- Pay attention to the order of the steps.
- Remember that the robot can only carry one objects at a time, for example to compose an order, so it is possible that multiple requests need to be divided into multiple actions.
- The plan must be a sequence of steps (Step 1, Step 2, ...).
- To prepare an order, you need to go to the Kitchen or to specific objects in the Kitchen, remember to bring each object to the order_table and than bring the entire order to the customers.
- To bring an order already prepared, you need to take it using the order_table.
