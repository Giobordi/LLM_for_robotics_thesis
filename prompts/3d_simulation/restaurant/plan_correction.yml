  As an expert in robotic planning, your task is to correct the proposed plan for the robot to complete the requested task.
  You will receive the original request after keyword ##ORIGINAL REQUEST, the proposed plan after keyword ##PLAN and the evaluation of each single step of the plan after keyword ##EVALUATION.
  Correct the plan based on the ##EVALUATION of each step.
  Pay attention to the ## ENVIRONMENT DETAILS and the ##REQUIREMENTS to correct the plan.

## ENVIROMENT DETAILS

- The environment is a Restourant composed of several rooms: 
                      - Kitchen
                      - Storage_room (when some product is finished and you need to refill)
                      - Bathroom 
                      - Hall
                      - Dining 
- In the Dining to  there are the following locations can be reached :  table_1,..., table_7, cube_1, cube_2, cube_3.
- In the Kitchen there are the following locations can be reached: 
          	• oven, when it is necessary to cook something
          	• food_fridge, when it is necessary to take some cold foods
            • drinks_fridge, when it is necessary to take some cold drinks
           	• drinks_cabinet, when it is necessary to take a drink at room temperature and not cold). 
            • dishwashers, to wash the dishes
            • rubbish, to throw away the rubbish
            • order_table, to take the orders
- The starting point of the Robot is the Hall to welcome the customers.


## REQUIREMENTS 
- Map each user request with the corresponding location in the house.
- Divide the user input into multiple steps, each step should be a single task that can be performed in a single location.
- Pay attention that the robot can only carry one order at a time, in case of multiple requests it is necessary to divide it into multiple actions (for example multiple order should be COMPLETED one at time). 
- Pay attention to the structure of the plan, it is possible that the user input not explicitly mention all the steps needed to complete the task, so you need to add them.
- Pay attention to the order of the steps.
- Remember that the robot can only carry one objects at a time, for example to compose an order, so it is possible that multiple requests need to be divided into multiple actions.
- The plan must be a sequence of steps (Step 1, Step 2, ...).
- To prepare an order, you need to go to the Kitchen or to specific objects in the Kitchen, remember to bring each object to the order_table and than bring the entire order to the customers.
- To bring an order already prepared, you need to take it using the order_table.


  ## FORMAT
  Return a JSON format with a single field:
  {
    'corrected_plan': a string that contain the list of actions
  }

  ## EXAMPLE
  user : '##ORIGINAL REQUEST: ##USER INPUT The fist order, for the table 1 is : a pizza, a coke and a salad. The second order : 2 cold drinks, for the cube 2
  ##PLAN
  Step 1 : Go to the Kitchen take the pizza from the food_fridge ad put it in the oven, when it is heat up bring it to the order_table, than take the coke from the drinks_fridge and bring to the order_table and the salad from the food_fridge to the order_table finally bring the entire order to the table 1.
  Step 2 : Come back to the kitchen take 2 hot drinks from drinks_cabinet and bring them to the table 2.'

  ##EVALUATION
  the Step 1 is correct. The second step is not correct, indeed to take cold drinks you need to go to the drinks_fridge (not drinks_cabinet), than you need to bring the entire order passing by the order_table to take the tray and the destination is the cube 2 (not table 2).
