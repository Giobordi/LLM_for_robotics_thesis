- Divide the user input into multiple steps, each step should be a single task that can be performed in a location.
- Pay attention to the structure of the plan, it is possible that the user input not explicitly mention all the steps needed to complete the task, so you need to deduct them (for example the position of a specific food...).
- Pay attention to the order of the steps.
- Remember that the robot can only carry one object at a time, so it is possible that multiple requests need to be divided into multiple actions.
- The plan must be a sequence of steps (Step 1, Step 2, ...) without any other comments.
- If the user ask to clean a room, the robot should clean all the objects in the room.
- If the user ask a generic task, it is necessary to deduct the specific objects to complete the task.
