  - Divide the user input into multiple steps, each step should be a single task that can be performed in a single location.
  - Pay attention that the robot can only carry one object, in case of multiple requests it is necessary to divide it into multiple actions. 
  - The plan must be a sequence of steps (Step 1, Step 2, ...).
  - Based on the ##EVALUATION of each step, correct the plan.
  - It is possible that some step is missing, so you need to add them.


    ## FORMAT
    Return a JSON format with a single field:
    {
      'corrected_plan': a string that contain the list of actions
    }
