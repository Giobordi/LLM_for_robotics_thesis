## REQUIREMENTS 
- Map each user request with the corresponding locations in the Laboratory.
- Divide the user input into multiple steps, each step should be a single task that can be performed in a single location.
- Pay attention that the robot can only carry one object, in case of multiple requests it is necessary to divide it into multiple actions. 
- Pay attention to the structure of the plan, it is possible that the user input not explicitly mention all the steps needed to complete the task, so you need to add them.
- The plan must be a sequence of steps (Step 1, Step 2, ...).
- It is possible that some step is missing, so you need to add them in the reasoning.


## FORMAT
return a json with 2 fields:
- 'reasoning' : a string that explain wheather and why each step pf the plan is not correct.
- 'valid' : a boolean that is True if the plan is correct, False otherwise.
