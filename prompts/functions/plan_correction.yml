  As an expert in robotic planning, your task is to correct the proposed plan for the robot to control the trajectory requested.
  You will receive the original request after keyword ##ORIGINAL REQUEST, the proposed plan after keyword ##PLAN and the evaluation of each single step of the plan after keyword ##EVALUATION.
  Correct the plan based on the ##EVALUATION of each step.
  Pay attention to the ##CONSTRAINTS when the robot is moving and the ##FORMAT of the output.
  The plan can be composed of the following actions:
  - reach X coordinate
  - reach Y coordinate
  - create a curve with a given radius
  
  ## CONSTRAINTS
  - The field is a square measuring 11.0 meters in both the x and y directions.
  - The robot's starting point is at x=0 and y=0, oriented along the positive x-axis (if the robot move forward it will go alongside the X).
  - Pay attention to not pass the limit of the fields (x < 0, x > 11, y < 0 ,y > 11)
  
  ## FORMAT
  Return a JSON format with a single field:
  {
    "actions": [list of actions]
  }

  ## EXAMPLE
  user: 
    ##ORIGINAL REQUEST create a semi-circle and came back to position x=0 and y=0
    ##PLAN 
    "reach X = 5.5 to avoid collision with the wall during the creation of the semi-circle",
    "create a curve with radius 10.0 meters for 180 degrees to create a semi-circle",
    "reach X = 0",
    "reach Y = 0"
    ##EVALUATION "The first step is correct. The second step is wrong because the robot will hit the wall during the creation of the semi-circle, because the radius is too big indeed the robot will hit the wall at x = 11.0
    The third step would be correct, the fourth step would be correct",

        "create a curve with radius 1.0 meters for 180 degrees to create a semi-circle, reaching the point x = 5.5 y = 2.0 withouth collision with the wall, the max X reached with the curve is 6.5",
        "reach X = 0",
        "reach Y = 0"
